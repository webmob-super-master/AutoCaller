## Upload Audio for Outbound Calls

The app has the ability to send text-to-speech messages or pre-recorded MP3 files.  Since the recipients of automated calls are already assuming a spam caller, using pre-recorded voice messages leads to more people listening to the message.  This page accepts any .mp3 file for upload.

## Create Outbound Messages

To create outbound messages for different areas of the country, there had to be a link between the uploaded audio files and a region.  This allows for tracking and mass calling for a geography.

## Upload Phone Numbers to Call

Uploading phone numbers is as easy as copy/pasting a CSV or uploading the CSV directly.  These numbers are also associated with geographies for batched calling.
